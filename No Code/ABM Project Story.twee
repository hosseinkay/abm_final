You show the article to a trusted adult ‚Äî maybe your parent, teacher, or librarian.

They laugh softly and say:

"Whenever you see something outrageous online, always ask three things:

1. Who published this?

2. Why did they publish it?

3. Where else is this story being reported?"

They pull up a news aggregator, and you notice no credible news source has mentioned anything about aliens in Central Park.

You dig deeper and find the website's About page:
"We create fake news for fun. None of our stories should be taken seriously."

You've uncovered a major clue.

Curious about the photo attached to the post, you perform a reverse image search.

The results show that the same alien photo was uploaded five years ago as part of an art installation in New Jersey.

One entry even labels it:
"Performance Art Piece: 'Visitors from Beyond'"

This strongly suggests the image isn't real evidence of today's events.

It's just another evening when you're scrolling through your social media feed.

A shocking headline flashes across the screen:

BREAKING: Aliens Land in Central Park, Eyewitnesses Stunned

New York City ‚Äî In a historic moment that experts are already calling "the most important event in human history," multiple witnesses have reported seeing unidentified flying objects descend onto Central Park late last night.

Dozens of stunned onlookers described a "blinding light" followed by the appearance of two thin, gray-skinned beings. Videos and blurry photos of the alleged aliens have flooded social media platforms, sparking worldwide excitement and debate.

"I was just walking my dog when I saw this huge glowing disc hover above the trees," said local resident Linda Marks. "Then I saw these creatures step out... they didn‚Äôt look human."

Anonymous officials, allegedly from a "special government task force," were spotted entering the park within minutes. Speculation is mounting that the government is already covering up the incident.

Though no major news networks have officially reported on the story, believers argue that mainstream media is deliberately suppressing the truth.

The situation continues to develop, and many urge the public to "stay awake" and "trust what they see with their own eyes."

Over 5,000 people have already shared it. Some comments are excited, others are skeptical.

You feel a rush of curiosity. Your best friend just reposted it, writing: "OMG you guys this is real!"

What do you do?
